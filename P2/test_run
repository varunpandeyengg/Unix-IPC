The File Server is up now. Enter commands to access the server.
         There are five basic commands to this utility:        
         1. READ <file_path>    - trigger a read fop operation on server. The result will be given by ipc_utility's stdout
         2. DELETE <file_path>  - trigger a delete fop operation on server and file will be deleted from server      
         3. EXIT                - shutdown the server gracefully and cleanup. Always recommended instead of CTRL+C   
         4. CLEAR               - clear the terminal screen
