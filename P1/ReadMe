							=======================================

Welcome to a PIST - Primitive IPC Simulation Tool! This is a Read me file that will walk you through the basic functionality of the project.

This project uses following files. All the files have individual help information. Please refer for details.
	a. common_includes.h
	b. client.c
	c. server.c
	d. Makefile

Client module is responsible of taking user's request and transfering it to the Server. Client also invokes the server. All communication  
are synced through SIGUSR1. If everything works alright, you will see an internal commandline '$'. Press EXIT to terminame. 

The project is executed by running the client (./Client). This triggers the following chain of events.
	1. Invoke Server by Cloning Client.
	2. Spawning Server to process (./Server)

For synchronization, signal SIGUSR1 is used. This is used for alerting that request/response is avaibable.
All the communication is done by a file. This file is "./ipc". Although it can be controlled by editing common_includes.h

Limited command size is imposed assuming that file path won't excceed PATH_MAX charecters.
Client Tokenizes the user i/p command by breaking the incoming commands with boundary condition as - ' ' or '\n'

Client uses the following protocol to communicate with the server. 
		      <Command_number>:<file_path>

Server simply rights the output and the result is displayed to user by the dumb client  

Command Number used for the protocol are as follows - 
        a. command_not_set = 0
        b. command_read = 1
        c. command_delete = 2
        d. command_exit = 3
	e. command_bad = 4


There are five basic commands to this utility:
         1. READ <file_path> - trigger a read fop operation on server. The result will be given by client's stdout
         2. DELETE <file_path> - trigger a delete fop operation on server and file will be deleted from server    
         3. EXIT - shutdown the server gracefully and cleanup. Always recommended instead of CTRL+C               
         4. CLEAR - clear the terminal screen                                                                     
         5. HELP - print this command information
