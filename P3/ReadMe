							=======================================

Welcome to a AIST - Intermediate IPC Simulation Tool! This is a Read me file that will walk you through the basic functionality of the project.

This project uses following files. All the files have individual help information. Please refer for details.
	a. common_includes.h
	b. server.c
	c. cliet.c
	d. Makefile
	e. test_run
	d. clean.sh

You can use Make in the following mode: -
	1. make - Builds the utility for you to run
	2. make clean - Clears all the files generated due to build process or runtime
	3. make debug - Builds the utility for you to debug using gdb

Client module is responsible of taking user's request and transfering it to the Server. Client also invokes the server. This module 
will implement 2 IPC mechanisms - posix shared memory and system V shared memory. If everything works alright, you will 
see an internal commandline '$'. Press EXIT to terminate.

The project is executed by running the client (./Client). This triggers Invokes Server by Cloning Client.
ipc_utility has a UNIX style option where you specify the IPC that you want to use. Check the following: -
./Client -i <ipc_name>                                                     
         Following are the expected IPC name. Please Note that these are case sensitive.
         3. POSIX_SHM                                                                 
         4. SYSTEMV_SHM 

Limited command size is imposed assuming that file path won't excceed PATH_MAX charecters. The max file size for reading is expected 
to be 450 BYTES. Although it is small, this is doen for the simplicity of the code. Afterall, my focus here is to use various IPCs and 
NOT file handling. Client Tokenizes the user i/p command by breaking the incoming commands 
with boundary condition as - ' ' or '\n'

Client uses the following protocol to communicate with the server. 
		      <Command_number>:<file_path>

Server simply rights the output and the result is displayed to user by the dumb client  

Command Number used for the protocol are as follows - 
        a. command_not_set = 0
        b. command_read = 1
        c. command_delete = 2
        d. command_exit = 3
	e. command_bad = 4


There are five basic commands to this utility:
	 1. LS - Lists all the files and folders in the currently active directory
         2. READ <file_path> - trigger a read fop operation on server. The result will be given by client's stdout
         3. DELETE <file_path> - trigger a delete fop operation on server and file will be deleted from server    
         4. EXIT - shutdown the server gracefully and cleanup. Always recommended instead of CTRL+C               
         5. CLEAR - clear the terminal screen                                                                     
         6. HELP - print this command information
