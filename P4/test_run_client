Welcome to a SIST - Socket IPC Simulation Tool!
         There are five basic commands to this utility: 
         1. LS                  - lists all the files and directories in the current folder
         2. READ <file_path>    - trigger a read fop operation on server. The result will be given by ipc_utility's stdout
         3. DELETE <file_path>  - trigger a delete fop operation on server and file will be deleted from server           
         4. CLEAR               - clear the terminal screen                                                               
         5. HELP                - print this command information                                                          
         6. EXIT                - shutdown the server gracefully and cleanup. Always recommended instead of CTRL+C
